But the service was below average and the chips were too terrible to finish. When we arrived at 1.40, we had to wait 20 minutes while they got our table ready. OK, so we didn't have a reservation, but the restaurant was only half full. There was no reason to make us wait at all. We ordered the chips as a side dish and they looked delicious. But, when we tasted them, they were overcooked and swimming in oil so we left most of them. We expected a lot more for $10! When the waiter asked if everything was ok, we said we really didn't like the chips and he said 'That's funny, I love them' and that was it. He didn't offer us anything else or take them off our bill. Also, when we didn't leave a tip, he looked annoyed. I was really excited about visiting Vega, and the mains were just fantastic, but the rest of the experience was really disappointing.`,

I went with my colleague there last Friday, they welcomed us and found us a good table which had a view to the kitchen for seeing the chiefs while working in. As a side menu they brought us a season salat, a green salad and yogurt that they famous for. We ordered steak with mushroom sos and chicken wings with special sos which were so delicious. All the time waiter were asking us if everything ok and they made up what we complained, they were so helpful. The thing that we didn't expected is the pill was very expensive. I was really excited about visiting a Turkish restaurant but I'll thing a lot before trying it another time because going to this tip of restaurant needs a big budget.

However when the waiter asked us if every thing was good, I mentioned for him that the salad was totally unexpected and I feel so bad about it. He was very polit and apologized for that. He offer me another tuna salad with a complementary fresh orange juice. The second tuna salad was great and well presented with fresh and juicy vegetables. I enjoyed my meal and the sea view.

We were already starving to death and mouth drooping to get a taste of quesadillas. When we finally had our ordered we were excited to dig in, the food was too oily and it wasn't worth the price. Though the place had a relaxing ambiance and good service the waitress was accomodating. That was one pricey restaurant. I never understood why there was a long queues. Perhaps It was just overrated since it is located in a bustling city. Anyway I love mexican food I've been to many mexican restaurant that served mouth watering dishes in a reasonable price.`,

Although restaurant was not so big and there were not so many customers, she coped with her work hardly. So we had to wait about twenty minutes until our order only was taken. I assume, the mains wasn't fresh and cookers just warmed them up. Also portions were too small and I stayed hungry.

I was so impressed by the chef Gordon Ramsay in that show, I think he has a high standard for all food. So when I know Singapore have a restaurant is belong to Chef Gordon, I was so expected. So I came for dinner with my friend, we all loved the mid-rate steak, so when ordered two mid-rate steaks, the food arrived fast. But when took the first bite, we are so disappointed, because both steaks are too old, that's like a well-done steak! So we tell this feedback to the waiters, but he just says, we will tell the chef. Then until we leave, nothing happened, no one tells me why our steak tastes too old. We also ordered a bottle of wine, but the tire condition is too cold for us, so we have to take away the wine, but without the air conditioner's temperature problem, the environment is better than the food! All in all, we are so disappointed. Hope they can improve the service skill and solve the steak problems.`,
